# Game of Thrones Web App

This is one of the interesting projects I decided to search and chanced on some basic tutorials which helped me achieve the goal.

The goal was to develop a simple web app which consumes some free APIs and show their results.

As I searched for free APIs to use in my project, I found a list of them on [HubSpot Blog](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/free-open-apis) which became very useful.

Among the various APIs, I decided to use the [Game of Thrones API](https://gameofthronesquotes.xyz/) and the [Youtube API search package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtube-api-search).

This project uses some basic concepts such as custom hooks, using [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), storing data in [localstorage](https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/localstorage-react/), consuming APIs and others.

The project is deployed [here](https://game-of-thrones-web-app.vercel.app/)
